# A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style

["A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)
 (Gatys, et al. 2015) is the source to this project idea. The implementation of this content-and-style transfer network is a collaboration with [@ruggeri](https://github.com/ruggeri).


## Implementation

The goal of this project is to transfer the style of an artwork to the content of a photograph. We use the VGG recognition network and the paper's clever perspective on understanding the "style" of an artwork (similar to an image's "texture").

## Results



## Future Directions

* ["Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155) (Johnson, et al. 2016)
* Speed up style transfer by training a network that generates the style transferred images. This will use a deep convolutional generator network (along with batch normalization and residual blocks).
